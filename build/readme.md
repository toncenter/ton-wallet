# Source code

We deliberately use plain js and do not use frameworks, due to the direct access to the user's private keys. We also try to use the minimum number of third party libraries and consciously include them as static files rather than NPM packages to prevent accidental upgrade to a potentially malicious versions.

# Preparation

Set required for build environment variables in shell or `.env` file in project root directory. See `.env.example` with required variables names and their description.

If need, update `version` field in `package.json` to increase version in output manifest.json files, source files and update anti-cache parameters values.

Install development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

# Tasks

To run build task use next template:

```
npm run {task} {target}
```

Possible tasks:
- `build` - create bundles in targets destination directories
- `watch` - autorebuild bundles on sources change
- `start` - open target in web-browser and autorebuild bundles on sources change (only for `web` target to test website wallet local)
- `pack` - create bundles and prepare it to publuish-ready form

Possible targets and bundle files destinations folder:
- `web` - docs
- `chromium` - artifacts/v3
- `firefox` - artifacts/v2
- `safari` - artifacts/v2
- `all` - run all targets

Possible targets for pack task and output files destinations:
- `chromium` - artifacts/chromium-ton-wallet-{version}.zip
- `firefox` - artifacts/firefox-ton-wallet-{version}.zip
- `safari` - build xcode project to ton-wallet/artifacts/safari
- `all` - run all targets

Where {version} - value from package.json "version" field

## Localization

Files with translated phrases locate it `src/locales` with name format `{locale-code}.json`. For date and time formatting using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` browsers API.

In sources all phrases used by its path in translation json file, like `"main.sending.title"`.

In HTML localization phrases can be added to element by setting `data-l` attribute with locale phrase path.

Adding new language to application:
- create file with translated phrases by `en.json` template
- add locale code and name to `AVAILABLE_LOCALES` object in `src/js/view/Locales.js`

For convenience of adding new translations, in Debug mode when hovering over an element with phrase prompt appears with phrase path.

## Switch between clear console and debug mode

- Support from 1.1.36 version
- Open menu in right-top corner and select `About` item
- Click on `Version:` label with Alt key pressed
